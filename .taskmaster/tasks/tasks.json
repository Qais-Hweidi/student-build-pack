This sets up the project folder and installs initial dependencies including TypeScript and related types automatically.\n<info added on 2025-06-16T14:23:05.457Z>\nTo avoid creating a nested project structure, temporarily move any existing files in the root directory that would conflict with create-next-app (such as .gitignore and README.md), ensuring the .taskmaster folder remains untouched. Run create-next-app with the TypeScript flag directly in the root directory. After initialization, merge back important content from the original files and clean up any redundant or duplicate files to maintain a clean, flat project structure.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T14:23:05.457Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-16T14:28:09.731Z>\nManual setup approach chosen due to create-next-app conflicts with existing files. Creating Next.js 14 project structure manually with the following steps: 1) Set up package.json with Next.js 14 and TypeScript dependencies, 2) Create tsconfig.json with Next.js TypeScript configuration, 3) Set up next.config.js for project configuration, 4) Create tailwind.config.ts for styling setup, 5) Establish src/ directory structure using app router architecture, 6) Install all required dependencies. This manual approach provides complete control over project structure and avoids nested folder issues while maintaining compatibility with existing project files.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T14:28:09.731Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-16T14:39:43.221Z>\nBased on latest research findings, critical version updates are required for the manual setup approach. The package.json dependencies need updating to Next.js 15.3 (latest stable) and React 19 (now stable and supported). Tailwind CSS should use version 3.4.1+ with preparation for upcoming 4.x structure that will use CSS-first configuration with @theme directive instead of JS config. The next.config.js must be updated to remove experimental.appDir flag as app router is stable in Next.js 15.x. PostCSS configuration should be prepared for Tailwind CSS 4.x using @tailwindcss/postcss plugin. These version updates ensure the project uses the most current stable technologies and follows latest best practices for Next.js 15 with React 19 compatibility.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T14:39:43.221Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-16T15:20:59.914Z>\nProject successfully upgraded to cutting-edge technology stack with full Node.js 24 compatibility. All major dependencies updated including React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5.8.3, @types/node 24.0.0, and ESLint 9.17.0. Completed major migration to Tailwind CSS v4.1.10 with new CSS-first configuration approach using @theme directive in globals.css instead of JavaScript config file. PostCSS configuration updated to use @tailwindcss/postcss plugin for v4 compatibility. Resolved all dependency conflicts through clean installation process. Build verification confirms successful compilation with Next.js 15.3.0, passing TypeScript checks, and working Tailwind v4 processing. Development environment now ready with latest stable versions and enhanced Node.js 24 performance optimizations.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T15:20:59.914Z>",
